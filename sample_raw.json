Here's what was updated:\n\n## Added Specific Gift:\n- **Recipient**: Glynn Fouche Jr (G-Money)\n- **Gift**: $10,000\n- **Has Specific Gifts**: Changed from \"false\" to \"true\"\n\n## Summary of How This Works:\nYour son Glynn Jr will now receive:\n1. **First**: The specific gift of $10,000 (paid out before the residuary distribution)\n2. **Then**: His 33.33% share of whatever remains in the estate after all specific gifts and expenses are paid\n\nThis means Glynn Jr benefits twice from your estate - once from the specific $10K gift and again from his equal share of the residuary estate.\n\nYour current will structure is now:\n- **Specific Gift**: $10,000 to Glynn Fouche Jr\n- **Residuary Distribution**: \n  - Glynn Fouche Jr: 33.33%\n  - Mike Kyle Fouche: 33.33%  \n  - Doctors without Borders: 33.34%\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to add or modify, or are you ready to proceed with generating your final will document?"
